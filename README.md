Hi thereðŸ‘‹, this is **@int0x19**

I'm currently a senior high school student at *Beijing No.8 High School*.

I'm interested in learning new techniques in C/C++, Python, Node.js, Haskell, Machine Learning, and etc.

But now I have to focus on my school courses, such as Maths, Phys and Chem, so I may not have many times on coding and exploring.

You're welcomed to reach me at the following ways:
